# Parallel Car Price Prediction in Python with Dask

We want to fit a linear regression model to predict the price of used cars on the US market. For this, we use the Python library [Dask](https://dask.org/) to parallelize the training of the model over a big dataset and want to measure the impact compared to the serial version.

For the training of the model we use the [US Used Cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset) which encompasses real world data of 3 million used cars from the US market.
